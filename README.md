# Multiple-linear-regression

A Multiple linear regression (MLR) model computes the dependent variable Y using a linear combination of independent variables X_k. 

The regression model requires that input variables (X) explain the output variable (Y), and furthermore that each input variable adds different information. 
The following methods were tested:
 
 - Forward selection 
 - Backward selection
 - Stepwise selection

by adjust of R-squared, Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), p-value, etc. 

Dependences:

    python - Pandas
    python - NumPy
    python - Matplolib
    python - Statsmodels
